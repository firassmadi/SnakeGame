# SnakeGame
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game that has entertained players for decades. It typically involves guiding a growing snake around a grid-based game board, eating food items, and avoiding collisions with the walls, obstacles, or itself. Below is a detailed description:

Gameplay Mechanics:
1. Objective:  
   - The player controls the movement of the snake to eat food items that randomly appear on the game board. Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length, and the player's score increases.

2. Controls:  
   - The snake is typically controlled using directional keys (up, down, left, right) or swipes (in touch-based versions).

3. Rules:  
   - The game ends if the snake:
     - Collides with the boundaries of the game board.
     - Bumps into itself (its tail or body).

4. Challenges:  
   - As the snake grows longer, navigating the game board becomes more challenging due to limited space.

5. Game Speed:  
   - In many versions, the snake's speed increases over time, adding to the difficulty.
